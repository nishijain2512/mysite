        <h1>Why Do We Have Time Zones On Earth?</h1>
        
        <p>If we had one single time zone for Earth, noon would be the middle of the day in some places, but it would be morning, evening, and the middle of the night in others. Since different parts of Earth enter and exit daylight at different times, we need different time zones.</p>
        <p>The late 1800s, a group of scientists figured out a way to divide the world into different time zones. In order to build the time zone map, they studied Earth's movements.</p>
        <p>As Earth rotates on its axis, it moves about 15 degrees every 60 minutes. After 24 hours, it has completed a full circle rotation of 360 degrees.The scientists used this information to divide the planet into 24 sections or time zones. Each time zone is 15 degrees of longitude wide.</p>
        <p>Having different time zones means that no matter where you live on the planet, your noon is the middle of the day when the sun is highest, while midnight is the middle of the night.</p>
